# System Design from First Principles

> Understanding modern distributed systems by starting with the problems they were built to solve.

Welcome!

This repository documents my journey of learning **System Design** from first principles. Instead of memorizing technologies or architectural patterns, the goal is to understand **why they exist**, **what problems they solve**, and **when they should be used**.

Every topic begins with a real-world problem, followed by the reasoning that led to the solution. Along the way, I use practical examples from applications like Uber, Netflix, WhatsApp, Instagram, and Amazon to connect concepts to real systems.

## Learning Philosophy

This repository follows one simple principle:

> **Understand the problem before learning the solution.**

For example:

- Why do we need a Load Balancer?
- Why isn't one database enough?
- Why do Docker and Kubernetes both exist?
- Why are message queues necessary?
- Why isn't caching as simple as storing data in memory?

By understanding the problem first, the solution becomes much easier to remember.
